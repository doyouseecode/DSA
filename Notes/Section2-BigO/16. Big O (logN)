How does the Big(logN) works

What is Log (Logarithm)

Logarithms answers to the questions, to what power must we raise a base
to get a number?

Example log8 = 3 ; because 2^3 = 8

In Computer Science
* Logarithmic Time O(log n): Algorithms that cut the problem size in half
each step.

Example is Binary search

* Tree structure: Height of balanced Trees is log(n)
Example is Binary search Tree, Heap

* Complexity analysis: Logarithms appear when data is divided, halved, or structured hierarchically.
