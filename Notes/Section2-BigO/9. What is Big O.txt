Big O is the language and metric to describe the efficiency of algorithms

Time Complexity: A way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of input increases.

Space complexity: How much memory the algorithms occupies

Sometimes Code A can be quicker than B, but might take up more memory and
Code B could take up less memory but be slower.
