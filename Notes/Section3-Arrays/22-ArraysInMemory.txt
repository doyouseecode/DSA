1) The way arrays are stored in the memory:
int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
So we've got a reference of the array: arr
* reference points to the first element in the array
* and then the consecutive elements will be connected together
For example:
* the address for the 1st element is x
* the address for the 2nd element is x + 1



2) 2D arrays in the memory are stored in 1D array format,
1st comes the 1st row, then second and so on

{[1,2,3],[1,34,5],[12,421,123]}
2D array is stored this way:
1,2,3,1,34,5,12,421,123
